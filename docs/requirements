We want to build a CRM system similar to Zendesk. This system should have the following features:

Tickets
- Tickets should be created from a template and should have basic fields like title, description, status, priority, assigned to, creation date by default.
- Templates should allow for custom fields to be added.
- Tickets should also have tags, internal notes and contain a full history of all changes.

Users
- Users should be split into two groups: Agents and Customers.

Agents
- Agents should have customizable views of tickets.
- Ticket updates should appear in real time
- Agents should be able to filter tickets by status and priority
- Agents should be able to update tickets in bulk
- Agents should have metrics tracked, including response time, resolution time and resolution rate

Customers
- Customers should view and update their tickets
- There should be a searchable knowledge base with articles and FAQs
- There should be an ai chatbot to answer questions
- There should be email integration to allow ticket creation from emails
- We potentially want to add additional channels for customer communication, such as phone and chat in the future
- Customers should be able to give feedback and rate their support experience after ticket resolution
